Purpose:
The purpose of this site is to improve the rental experience for customers. Users can add the items they own for rent, such as a phone or a bicycle, which you can't typically rent on traditional rental sites.

How the site works and the idea behind it:
On this site, users can rent out anything they own. If their item doesn't fit into an existing category, they can create their own and manage it. You can also set your own conditions for rentals, which will be managed 
in a strict lease system to be implemented at a later date. This site is more user-managed and self-sufficient.

Summary and ending note:
In summary, this site was created to disrupt traditional rental sites, but that doesn't mean you can't also sell your items. That's right! You can rent, sell, and even give away your items on our revolutionary site!
